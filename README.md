This project is a deep learning-based Lung Cancer Detection model that classifies CT scan images into three categories: Malignant (Cancerous), Benign (Non-cancerous), and Normal (Healthy) with 90-95% accuracy. Built using Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2), it ensures high accuracy while remaining fast and efficient. The model is trained on a structured dataset stored in Google Drive the link to which is (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UZwcPjJQsIjUq-p20ssC1nKgf80ezYen?usp=sharing), with images categorized into Malignant, Benign, and Normal folders. Using TensorFlow, Keras, and Google Colab, this model enables users to upload a CT scan image and receive an instant classification result. The dataset is augmented and class-balanced to improve the identification of Benign cases, ensuring better generalization and reduced bias. The model achieves ~95% training accuracy and ~90-93% validation accuracy, with prediction times of just 1-2 seconds per image. Future updates include a medicine recommendation system based on detection results and possible web app deployment for ease of access. To use this model, simply clone the repository, upload the dataset to Google Drive, and run the Colab notebook to train and test the model. The project is open-source , and contributions are welcome!
